Noctics Roadmap Toward $1M Asset Value
======================================

0. Baseline
-----------
- Ensure pytest + lint suites succeed in CI.
- Track adoption metrics from existing installs.

1. Instrumentation Expansion
----------------------------
- Ship Anthropic and Gemini (or DeepSeek) SDK-backed instruments with parity routing tests.
- Publish a lightweight instrument plug-in protocol for external contributors.

2. Packaging & Supply Chain
---------------------------
- Sign release artifacts; add checksum verification to `prepare_assets.sh`.
- Provide container images and signed installers for air-gapped deployment.
- Harden core-pyd distribution so binaries load as first-class Python packages.

3. Experience Layer
-------------------
- Layer a TUI or lightweight desktop shell on top of the session vault.
- Formalise scripted workflows (`/review`, `/deploy`, etc.) with documentation.

4. Observability & Operations
----------------------------
- Emit optional Prometheus/OpenTelemetry hooks for sessions, latency, and instrument usage.
- Document retention policies and JSONL schemas for enterprise compliance.

5. Traction & GTM
-----------------
- Publish public docs and case studies demonstrating productivity wins.
- Define tiered licensing (community vs. pro vs. enterprise) and pilot with early adopters.

6. Follow-ups
-------------
- Schedule quarterly roadmap reviews; update this plan after major releases.
- Maintain alignment between `agents.plan` and `core/AGENTS.md`.

      "assistant_final": "Here are three ARC-specific strategies tailored to segmenting multi-color grids, focusing on 4-connectivity, 8-connectivity, color cluster splitting, adjacency graphs, and reconstruction ordering:\n\n- **4-Connectivity Strategy**: Use 4-connectivity to identify distinct color clusters by connecting only to immediate north, south, east, and west neighbors. This approach helps maintain clear boundaries between clusters, ensuring that each cluster is distinctly recognized without interference from diagonal connections.\n\n- **Color Cluster Splitting**: Implement a strategy to recursively split large clusters of the same color into smaller, manageable clusters. This is beneficial for computational efficiency and allows for processing clusters in parts, ensuring that they meet specific problem constraints.\n\n- **Adjacency Graphs for Reconstruction**: Utilize adjacency graphs to represent the connections between different clusters or cells in the grid. Each node represents a cluster, and edges indicate connectivity. This graph structure can be analyzed to determine the order of reconstruction, using methods like topological sorting to respect dependencies.\n\nInstrument: gpt-4o → These insights will help you effectively tackle the challenges of segmenting tangled color blobs while preserving layer order for reconstruction.",
